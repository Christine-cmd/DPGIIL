# DPGIIL: Dirichlet process-deep generative model-integrated incremental learning for clustering in transmissibility-based online structural anomaly detection

This repository contains the official implementation of the DPVIIL framework presented in our paper:

- **"DPGIIL: A Dirichlet Process Deep Generative Model Framework for Online Structural Anomaly Detection"**
- "toy_dataset" contains TF vectors of the numerical case study in the paper for testing

and the streaming variational inference-empowered Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture models (with the greedy split-merge scheme) presented in:
- **"Streaming variational inference-empowered Bayesian nonparametric clustering for online structural damage detection with transmissibility function"**
